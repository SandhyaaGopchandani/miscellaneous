# My GitHub Page


This Github repository contains small projects that I have been doing as part of my class work as well as personal interest.

# Currently added projects
- Bitcoin Historical Data Analysis
  - In this project, I am analyzing the Bitcoin price dataset to find out the patterns in price changes. The dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory) is available online on Kaggle. The analysis is done in Python using Jupyter notebook. In order to run this project, you will need to install Jupyter Notebook: http://jupyter.org/ and run .ipynb file available on the Github. The folder contains a python notebook file, HTML file as well as report that would illustrate the results of my analysis.   
- Final Year Project - Controllo
  - This is a group project during final year during my undergradute.  The project comprises of an android application and microcontroller Arduino to help motor disabled people in controlling the room appliances using their facial gestures. In order to run the project, you will need to install Android Studio ( https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and have access to Arduino (https://www.arduino.cc/) The code for application and Arduino is available in the git repository along with documentation that would thoroughly explain the project.

- Voice Enabled Flash Cards
  - This is a personal project. The idea was to build an android application that would enable users to make flash cards using their speech. The project uses Android Studio that can be installed using this link: https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html

- Closest Pair Algorithm
  - Closest Pair Algorithm is a Brute-Force algorithm that computes the distances between all pairs of points and then pick the pair with the smallest distance. I have implemented this algorithm as part of my classwork.

- Karatsuba Multiplication
  - Karatsuba Multiplication is a fast multiplication algorithm that uses Divide and Conquer underneath. I have implemented this algorithm using Java in Eclipse IDE.
 
- Twitter Sentiment Analysis
  - Sentiment Analysis of twitter tweets in Java. This was done as part of class work.
- Page Replacement Algorithms
  - Three page replacement algorithms: First In First Out (FIFO), Least Recently Used (LRU) and Optimal Page replacement algorithms are implemented using C language. The results show that Optimal performs better than the two.

- Disk Scheduling Algorithms
  - Implemented and compared the results of three disk scheduling algorithms - FCFS, SCAN and C-SCAN - using C programming language.

- LinkedList and Thread Implementation
  - Implementation of linkedlist and Inter-thread communication using pthreads and mutexes in C.

- Linear Regression Implementation
  - One variable linear regression implementation in MATLAB as part of an online coursera ML course. 
- Logistic Regression Implementation
  - One variable logistic Regression implementation in MATLAB as part of an online coursera ML course.
- Why I am interested in Cryptocurrency
  - This document describes why I got interested in analyzing cryptocurrency mainly bitcoin.
- Global Alarm Prototype
  - A prototype that would let you set an alarm for different timezones without manually calculating the timedifference. This prototype is made using JustInMind software.
